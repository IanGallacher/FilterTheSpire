  "description": "Go to the Main Menu -> Mods -> Filter the Spire -> Config menu to configure the seeds you encounter. This mod currently allows configuring which boss relic swap you get from Neow, and allows choosing randomly from a set of multiple possibilities. Future updates plan on adding more filters beyond just the Boss Swap option. NOTE: This mod includes a patch that will ALWAYS guarantee the full 4 Neow bonuses, even if you did not complete the previous run.\n\n Please see https://github.com/casey-c/FilterTheSpire for further details and to find new updates when they are released.",
