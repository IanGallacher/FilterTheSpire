  "description": "Upon starting a new game, this mod will refresh the run until you have a seed where the boss swap is a guaranteed Pandora's Box (with a maximum number of 300 tries for safety). NOTE: This mod includes a patch that will ALWAYS guarantee the full 4 Neow bonuses, even if you did not complete the previous run.\n\n Please see https://github.com/casey-c/FilterTheSpire for further details and upcoming releases.",
