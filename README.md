Upon starting the game, this mod refreshes the seed until the boss swap is guaranteed to be a pandora's box. Planned updates are to improve the aesthetics a bit (currently, it just hangs for a bit at the neow screen with no visual feedback) and more importantly - this mod will eventually serve as a seed filtering mod (you'll be able to customize what boss swap you want, what bosses you encounter, etc.).

### Important notes

In its current state, it's a bit ugly and unpolished. However, it should be functional for pandora's box swaps only. There is a slight "cheat" built in to guarantee you always get the 4 neow choices (even if you don't reach the first boss). This is intended to make it both easier to test and debug, while also following the idea that if you have this mod installed, you are probably looking to use the boss swap.

It is worth noting that the rest of the game is entirely vanilla - the seed it finds is completely untouched, and should functional identical to the behavior without the mod. Thus, you can choose other Neow rewards and not take the boss swap if you so choose, but please note that this will guarantee that you see it within the Act 1 boss relic rewards screen.


### Installation

This mod requires ModTheSpire and BaseMod. (You can find those on the steam workshop). To install, head over to the releases page, download the latest .jar file and drag it into the SlayTheSpire/mods folder in your game's install directory.
